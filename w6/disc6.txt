1.  What are response surface curves?  How do they help in visualizing optimization?

    These are the representations of interactions among multiple input variables to one or more response variables.  They may show you how a range of possible inputs, each changing dependently or independently, produce another range of outputs.  This can help with the intuitive, visually obvious optimization of (max or min, for example) a response variable.


2.  Share some code from last week that was particularly rewarding or frustrating.  We will comment on it.

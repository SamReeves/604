    "The amount of money each is given will be based on an estimated average/mean salary for 2020.  We do not have complete information from later years.  The mean was \\$53,383, and the median \\$34,612.  Theoretically, half of the people should have a salary below the median, and the median and mean should line up.  In reality, this figure is highly skewed:\n",

So, for this experiment, we will assume that the hyper rich don't care for hotdogs, and that the median salary is the most realistic for the most people.  Median household salary for 2020 was around \\$67,000 according to the US Census, and the poverty line for a 3-person household was \\$21700 according to the department of Health and Human Services.\n",

We will generate this information on an exponential curve with lambda equal to 10. A score closer to zero will mean you don't care how hot or cold it is -- you gotta have those wieners.\n",
